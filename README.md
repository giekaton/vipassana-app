#### About Vipassana App

Vipassana is a classic Buddhist meditation. It can be practiced by anyone, as there is nothing inherently religious about it.

Vipassana does not involve any esoteric techniques and the only thing required is to see reality the way it manifests itself at any given moment. In the Pali language, the word vipasyana means seeing things clearly, and this is the essence of the Vipassana practice.

The core principle of Vipassana is not to expect anything and accept everything. Experiences come and go. This principle is called 'Equanimity', and it requires you not to crave pleasant experiences, and not try to avoid the unpleasant ones. You should only see the reality the way it is at any given moment.

Experiences that you notice can be your body sensations, feelings or thoughts. They are represented in the practice window by eight symbols. Every time you notice an experience, click on its symbol. It can appear several times repeatedly, then just notice-click it several times.

The eight symbols represent the following experiences:

#### App

You can install the Vipassana App on most of mobile and desktop devices and use it even when you are offline. It doesn't require an internet connection.

After each meditation session, you will see a little window with statistics about your experiences. The data is not saved anywhere and is restarted with every new session.

On a desktop computer, you can meditate with your keyboard's keypad numbers (right side). The keypad numbers have the same positions as the eight experiences in the app, the central start/stop button is the keypad's number 5, and Escape is for closing the stats window.
