          <h2>About</h2>
      
          Vipassana is a classic Buddhist meditation. It can be practiced by anyone, as there is nothing inherently religious about it.
          <br>
          <br>
          Vipassana does not involve any esoteric techniques, and the only requirement is seeing reality as it is at any given moment. In the Pali language, the word <i>vipasyana</i> means <i>seeing things clearly</i>, and this is the essence of the Vipassana practice.
          <br>
          <br>
          The core principle of Vipassana is not to expect anything and accept everything. Experiences come and go. This principle is called 'Equanimity', and it requires you not to crave pleasant experiences, and not try to avoid the unpleasant ones. You should only see the reality the way it is at any given moment.
          <br>
          <br>
          Experiences that you notice can be your body sensations, feelings or thoughts. They are represented in the practice window by eight symbols. Every time you notice an experience, click on its symbol. It can appear several times repeatedly, then just notice-click it several times.
          <br>
          <br>
          The eight symbols represent the following experiences:<br>

          Because of its visual and gamified nature, the Vipassana App works instantly and effortlessly. It activates our inner observer who is witnessing our experiences. Even one minute of the practice can break an ongoing pattern of thoughts and feelings, and allow us to look at our experiences from a new and clear prespective.
          <br>
          <br>
          This app is not a substitute for the 10 days Vipassana retreat, but it can work efficiently under modern living conditions. The practice is immediate because of the gamified nature of the app - you can "play" it only when you shift your attention to your inner world. When you play-meditate with the Vipassana App, you detach from the stimulating environment and start observing what is happening inside - this practice is centering, relaxing and leads to meaningful insights.

          <h2>App</h2>

          You can 
          <span v-if="$parent.mobileChrome" @click="installPWA" class="link-alike">install</span>
          <span v-else>install</span> the 
          Vipassana App on most of mobile and desktop devices and use it even when you are offline. It doesn't require an internet connection.
          <br>
          <br>
          After each meditation session, you will see a little window with statistics about your experiences. The data is not saved anywhere and is restarted with every new session.
          <br>
          <br>
          On a desktop computer, you can meditate with your keyboard's keypad numbers (right side). The keypad numbers have the same positions as the eight experiences in the app, the central start/stop button is the keypad's number 5, and Escape is for closing the stats window.
          <br>
          <br>
          Vipassana App is inspired by Vipassana meditation technique, as described in Shinzen Young's book 'Five Classic Meditations', and by the talk 'Vipassana for Hackers'.



          <h2>Disclaimer</h2>

          Vipassana App shouldn't be taken too seriously. It's more like an art project than a meditation tool. It's an interactive visual way to explain Vipassana. Actually, you don't need any app at all for Vipassana meditation practice. Sure, you can meditate using the app and it might help, but keep in mind that the real Vipassana doesn't require an app.
